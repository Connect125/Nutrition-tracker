# Nutrition-tracker
This application works has a daily nurtition tracker. It allows the user to enter calories, fat, and salt intake for a given day over 5 meals, and returns some Statistics about the you're intake over the day. It also alows for the importing and exporting of files to allow you to track your nurtition intake over a longer period of time if you wish.
GIU should provide all information for using the application, and there should be custom error messages if ignored.

All files will be written and read from the project directory (NutritionTracker).
